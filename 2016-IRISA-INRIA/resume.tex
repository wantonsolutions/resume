\section{RESEARCH}
{\sl Dinv} \hfill 2015-2016\\
    Distributed System Invariant Detector
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
        \item Dinv detects data invariants in distributed systems by temporally associating logged variables.
        \item Developed novel distributed state merging algorithms, and automatic insturmentation techniques.
        %\item Research Mentored by Dr.Ivan Beschastnikh, University of British Columbia
        \item https://bitbucket.org/bestchai/dinv
\end{itemize}

{\sl Dovid} \hfill 2015-2016\\
    Distributed System Documenter
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
        \item Dovid automatically generated documenation for distributed systems.
        \item Documentation includes discriptions of variables affected, and affecting network traffic, and network communication points
        %\item Research Mentored by Dr.Ivan Beschastnikh and Dr.Reid Holmes, University of British Columbia
        \item https://bitbucket.org/wantonsolutions/Dovid
\end{itemize}

{\sl Pangaea [In development]} \hfill 2016\\
    Distributed State Visualizer
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
        \item Pangaea plots distributed snapshots by grouping snapshots with similar states.
